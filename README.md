# SmallAssignment
This is just for fun.We have two problems here. First is full fleged project based on express js and second one is a single file app based on python.

1. For Running First Project install NPM AND (Express, Node and MySQL with NPM). Then run it.

2. For Running Second Project install and import requests,datetime, zipfile, io,BeautifulSoup(bs4)

There may be several bugs in both of the projects. Thank you so much.
